Initially, I considered reading the entire log file into memory to filter the logs for the given date. However, this approach would be inefficient for large files (1 TB) and would consume a lot of memory.

I explored using `grep` or similar tools to filter logs. While this approach is efficient, it requires external tools and might not work in all environments.

The final solution uses file streaming and line-by-line reading, which ensures that the system memory usage stays low. This is the most efficient solution for large files as it minimizes memory usage while still extracting logs efficiently.
